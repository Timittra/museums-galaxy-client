# Museum's Galaxy

## About Project:
This _react_ project is integrated with _node.js_ to make it medium level _full-stack_ website. On this client side I have used **React Router**, **private route** for making it authentic. It needs **google sign in** credentials for buying any events. Basically this website is for purchasing tickets for museum events. And finally after **booking** your order will be confirmed by your email address, stripe information and order page will provide you with your **order information** which is hide from other users. Again there is an admin panel from where admin can **add events** for this website and **delete** from the website, also **update status** of events. These whole things are connected through **mongodb, firebase, github and heroku**.
